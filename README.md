### Setting up Firebase

1. **Create a Firebase project**:

   - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.

2. **Enable Firestore**:

   - In the Firebase Console, navigate to Firestore Database and create a new database.

3. **Enable Firebase Authentication**:

   - Go to the Authentication section and enable Anonymous authentication.

4. **Enable Cloud Storage**:
   - Navigate to Storage and create a new storage bucket.

### Firebase Configuration

Create a file named `firebaseConfig.js` in the root of your project and add your Firebase configuration:

```javascript
// firebaseConfig.js
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app'
import { getFirestore } from 'firebase/firestore'
import { getStorage } from 'firebase/storage'

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  authDomain: 'your-auth-domain',
  projectId: 'your-project-id',
  storageBucket: 'your-storage-bucket',
  messagingSenderId: 'your-messaging-sender-id',
  appId: 'your-app-id',
  measurementId: 'your-measurement-id',
}

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig)
const db = getFirestore(app)
const storage = getStorage(app)

export { db, storage }
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase project credentials.

Ensure your development environment includes React Native and Expo CLI. Refer to the React Native documentation for detailed setup instructions.

Usage
To run the app on your device:

```bash
npx expo start
```

This command starts the development server and opens a web page with QR codes to open the app on your iOS or Android device using the Expo Go app.

## Running the App

Scan the QR code with your device using the Expo Go app or run on an iOS or Android simulator.
